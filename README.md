Memory game, with the 16 cards that shuffles every time the player starts a game. The player has only 45 seconds of find the matching 8 motorbike cards.

# UX

## Website owner business goals
I have created a memory game using html, CSS and JavaScript. I've combined the love of simple memory game and motorbikes. I decided on hiding 8 pairs of motorbikes underneath 16 motorbike helmets. I gave a player 45 second to find the pairs. It is challenging, but I’ve successful won against the clock few times.

### User goals
#### New user goals
Memory game, with 8 pairs of cards, that shuffles every time the player starts a game. The player has only 45 seconds of find the matching 8 motorbike cards, if not a alert message will appear “times up”

#### Returning user goals
A returning player can challenge her/himself and test their memory and find out if is getting any better. 


### User stories
#### As a website owner
I've noticed a massive trend in last few years of memory or matching games being very popular and I'm a user myself. In creating this game I've combined the love of motorbikes and simple challenge 

#### New user 
A simple card game which helps to train memory and can be used as a challenge. 

#### Returning user goals
A returning player can test themselves if they memory got any better. 


### Structure of the website
The game is structured on a single page that includes the game name, pop out window explaining the rules of the game. There are 16 cards (squares) with 8 matching cards, which are faced down and the user can only see the identical faceup image which is a image of a helmet. The player has 45 seconds to match all 8 pairs or an alert with “times up” will come up. The player then can resume the game, the cards will be reshuffled, and the timer will start again. If the player beats the 45 second a congratulation message will appear when all cards matched.

### Wireframes
Initial draft of how the website should look like, I've changed few things as I've learn more about html and css and javascript
